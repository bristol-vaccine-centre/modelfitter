# Convert a dataframe to a huxtable with nested rows and columns.

The assumption here is that the input data is a long format tidy
dataframe with both rows and columns specified by values of the
`rowGroupVars` and `colGroupVars` columns. The long format (sparse)
table is translated into a nested tree of rows (using `rowGroupVars`)
and a nested tree of columns (from `colGroupVars`). Individual data
items are placed in the cell intersecting these two trees. If there are
multiple matches an additional layer of grouping is added to the
columns.

## Usage

``` r
.hux_tidy(
  tidyDf,
  rowGroupVars,
  colGroupVars,
  missing = "—",
  na = "—",
  displayRedundantColumnNames = FALSE,
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- tidyDf:

  A dataframe with row groupings (as a set of columns) and column
  groupings (as a set of columns) and data, where the data is in a tidy
  format with a row per "cell" or cell group.

- rowGroupVars:

  A dplyr::vars(...) column specification which will define how rows are
  grouped

- colGroupVars:

  A dplyr::vars(...) column specification with defines how columns will
  be grouped

- missing:

  If there is no content for a given rowGroup / colGroup combination
  then this character will be used as a placeholder

- na:

  If there are NA contents then this character will be used.

- displayRedundantColumnNames:

  if there is one column per column group the name of that column may be
  irrelevant (e.g. if there is a `col_name`, `value` fully tidy format)
  and `col_name` is in the `colGroupVars` list then the name of the
  column `value` is redundant and not displayed by default. However
  sometimes you want to display this if you have named it as something
  specific e.g. including the units. If there is more than one column
  per `colGroup` the column titles are needed and kept.

- ...:

  passed to `hux_default_layout()`
