# Delete stale files in a cache

Staleness is determined by the number of days from 2am on the current
day in the current time-zone. A item cached for only one day becomes
stale at 2am the day after it is cached. The time is configurable and
option(cache.time_day_starts = 0) would be midnight. Automated analysis
using caches and updated data should ensure that analysis does not cross
this time point otherwise it may end up using old data.

## Usage

``` r
.cache_delete_stale(.cache = .cache_loc(), .prefix = ".*", .stale = Inf)
```

## Arguments

- .cache:

  the location of the cache as a directory. May get its value from
  `getOption("cache.path")` or the default value which is
  `rappdirs::user_cache_dir(<package_name>)`

- .prefix:

  (optional) a name of the operation so that you can namespace the
  cached files and do selective clean up operations on them with
  .cache_clear()

- .stale:

  the length of time in days before considering cached data as stale.

## Value

nothing. called for side effects.
